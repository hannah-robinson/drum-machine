# Drum Machine project for freeCodeCamp Front End Libraries Certification

![Screenshot of app](https://github.com/hannah-robinson/drum-machine/blob/main/drum-machine.jpg)

I built this drum machine as an assessed project for freeCodeCamp's Front End Libraries certification. I chose jQuery and Bootstrap for this project to practice using them and because they were two of the libraries covered in the course. (I used React – the other JavaScript library covered in the course – for the other four course projects.) I designed the project to meet the requirements of freeCodeCamp's acceptance criteria. The user stories can be seen here: [freeCodeCamp Drum Machine User Stories](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-libraries/front-end-libraries-projects/build-a-drum-machine).

## See the live app

A live version of the drum machine can be found at: [hannah-robinson.github.io/drum-machine](https://hannah-robinson.github.io/drum-machine/)

## How to play

There are 9 drum pads on the drum machine, each with a different percussive sound. You can play a drum pad either by clicking on it or by typing the letter shown on that drum pad. The pad's sound will play, and the display at the top of the page will tell you the name of the percussion instrument.

## Built with:

- jQuery
- Bootstrap 5
- Sass/SCSS
- HTML
