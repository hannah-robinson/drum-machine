# Drum Machine project for freeCodeCamp Front End Libraries Certification

I built this drum machine as an assessed project for freeCodeCamp's Front End Libraries certification. I chose jQuery for this project to practice using it as it was one of the libraries taught in the course. (I used React – the other JavaScript library covered in the course – for the other four course projects.) The project was designed to meet the requirements of freeCodeCamp's acceptance criteria. The User Stories can be seen here: (freeCodeCamp Drum Machine User Stories)[https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-libraries/front-end-libraries-projects/build-a-drum-machine].

Built with:

- jQuery
- Bootstrap 5
- Sass/SCSS
- HTML
