# Drum Machine project for freeCodeCamp Front End Libraries Certification

I built this drum machine as an assessed project for freeCodeCamp's Front End Libraries certification. I chose jQuery for this project to practice using it as it was one of the libraries taught in the course. (I used React – the other JavaScript library covered in the course – for the other four course projects.) The project was designed to meet the requirements of freeCodeCamp's acceptance criteria. The User Stories can be seen here: [freeCodeCamp Drum Machine User Stories](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-libraries/front-end-libraries-projects/build-a-drum-machine).

## How to play

There are 9 drum pads on the drum machine, each with a different percussive sound. You can play a drum pad either by clicking on it or by typing the letter shown on that drum pad. The pad's sound will play, and the display at the top of the page will tell you the name of the percussion instrument.

## Built with:

- jQuery
- Bootstrap 5
- Sass/SCSS
- HTML
